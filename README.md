# UI-Kit
A complete set of user interface elements to help designers create high quality, consistent, experiences for all our digital brands.

## Getting Started
Each element in this UI Kit corresponds to the coded element found in the GUI. They follow the same naming convention and general structure: Module - Element - Style - Size. All the elements in the Sketch file are re-usable symbols with overrides for text, icons, multiple states etc. Where possible elements have been made responsive making it very easy to re-size them in multiple grid layouts. This will help designers quickly create responsive designs that align with the digital brand and the GUI elements.

## Before you start
1. Make a cup of tea and have a good look through the GEL and the GUI https://gel.westpacgroup.com.au. Familiarise yourself with the GUI elements so you understand how to use them properly in your design. There’s a lot in there so take your time. We’ve tried to keep text to a minimum but please read what is says. Don’t just look at the pictures.
2. It’s important to understand how the responsive grid works e.g. offsets, spans, nesting etc. Have a look at a GUI demo page. It's a good way to get your head around how the fluid grid works at different breakpoints. https://gel.westpacgroup.com.au/GUI/WBC/examples/tabcordions/4.1.0/ex8/demo/?v=0.2.0
3. Make sure you’ve installed all the fonts in the Global-Assets folder.
4. You’ll need Sketch 42 or later to open all this stuff.
5. Set up this application keyboard short cut: Collapse Artboards and Groups  Alt + Cmd + C
6. Install the Sketch-Palettes plugin by Andrew Fiorillo. https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes This will allow you load the correct colour palettes for each of our brands.
7. Make sure you subscribe to the GUI update email. We'll let you know when new versions of the UI Kit are released. https://gel.westpacgroup.com.au/GUI/

## Quick Start
1. Choose a brand and open the UI-Kit.
2. Additional assets can be found in the Global Assets folder.
  
## Heads up
All the GUI elements and spacing are based on a unit of 6. This puts visual consistency and rhythm into the design. You’ll notice this in things like the button heights and input field heights etc. The Templates also use a 6px baseline grid to vertically space and size elements.
  
## Going Multi-Brand
All the symbols in the UI-Kit align to our multi-brand design system:- colour, typography, iconography and the grid. Using a combination of Symbols, Layer Styles and Text Styles each element aligns to the design system. Adjusting these styles to reflect the new brand will update all the symbols in your design.

## Doing a Markup
We currently use Zeplin or InVision for sharing files with developers. This works well however it does not allow use to use the explicit name of an element. For example when specifying elements from the GUI you refer to them by their name. For example Striped Row Table or Primary Soft Button. This is all the developer needs to know. The CSS will take care of the styles. We’re still investigating how this can be achieved using Zeplin or InVision.

## Exporting svg’s
We’re working with the developers on a process to export svg’s from Sketch. The current Sketch svg export plugins don’t do a very good job.

## FAQ’s

### What is the UI Kit?
The UI Kit is a Sketch document containing all the elements found in the GUI. These elements are identical to the HTML elements used in the GUI framework. You can use these elements in your designs as and when you need them.
A huge amount of time and effort has gone into developing these elements to ensure they are accessible, aligned with the HTML GUI and work in our multi-brand design system.

### Why should I use the UI Kit?
If you don’t use it or choose to ignore or alter these styles, people will get upset, there will be wide spread confusion, deadlines will be missed, costs will blow out, you will have to attend even more meetings and all will not be well with the world. If you use these styles you will be a happy bunny and everyone will love you.

### I’m designing a native app. Do I still use the UI Kit?
There’s no reason not to. The visual style of the GUI elements applies to all interfaces as this is our digital brand. You may need to use native UI elements which is OK just be aware of the digital brand and the customer journey. Where have users come from and where are they going from here.

### What if the element I need is not in the UI Kit?
The GUI only covers the basic core UI elements common to most interfaces. Bespoke elements more than likely need to be designed. If that’s the case, knock yourself out. If you design something good and it gets re-used it will probably end up in the GUI and you will be famous.

### Can I add cool embellishment to the UI elements like bevels and textured backgrounds?
No.

### Can I tweak and change things just slightly?
Not unless you have a good rationale explaining the problem you're trying to solve? Your project is part of a customer journey. Every change and variation to the UI fragments the customer journey and dilutes the brand integrity.

### Why Sketch?
Because that’s what designers want to use. Due to popular demand Sketch is the tool of choice for both UX and Visual designers.

### Who do I contact for help?
If you have any questions or want to share some ideas, please get in contact with the GEL team via gel@westpac.com.au.
